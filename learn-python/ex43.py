"""
Aliens have invaded a spaceship and our hero has to go through a maze of rooms 
defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet below. The game
will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways
die. The game will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes. 
Each room will print it's own description when the player enters it and then tell
the engine what room to run next out of the map.
