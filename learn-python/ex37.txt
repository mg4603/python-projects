Operators

Some of these may be unfamiliar to you, but look them up anyway. Find out what they do, and if
you still canâ€™t figure it out, save it for later.

+   :   addition operator - adds the two operands

-   :   subtraction operator - subtracts second operand from the first
        unary minus - negates the operand

*   :   multiplication - multiplies the two operands

**  :   exponentiation - returns the first operand raised to the power of the second
        operand

/   :   division - returns the first operand divided by the second operand

//  :   Floor division - returns the integer part of the quotient from dividing the 
        first operand by the second 

%   :   Modulus - the remainder when dividing the fist operand by the second
