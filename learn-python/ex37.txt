Operators

Some of these may be unfamiliar to you, but look them up anyway. Find out what they do, and if
you still canâ€™t figure it out, save it for later.

+   :   addition operator - adds the two operands

-   :   subtraction operator - subtracts second operand from the first
        unary minus - negates the operand

*   :   multiplication - multiplies the two operands

**  :   exponentiation - returns the first operand raised to the power of the second
        operand

/   :   division - returns the first operand divided by the second operand

//  :   Floor division - returns the integer part of the quotient from dividing the 
        first operand by the second 

%   :   Modulus - the remainder when dividing the fist operand by the second

<   :   Less than operator  - check if the lhs value is less than the rhs value

>   :   Greater than operator - check if the lhs value is greater than the rhs value

<=  :   Less than equal to operator - check if lhs value is less than or equal to the rhs value

>=  :   Greater than equal to operator - Check if lhs value is greater than equal to rhs value

==  :   Equality operator - Check if two operands are equal

!=  :   Not equal operator - Check if the two operands are not equal
